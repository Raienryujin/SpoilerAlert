# SpoilerAlert
An extension to help determine if the on screen media contains spoilers

Concept Overview
Content Script: This script will scan the text of the webpage for potential spoiler content.
Background Script: Handles any necessary background tasks, although for this project, most logic will likely reside in the content script.
UI Elements: Simple UI elements such as a popup or badge that alerts the user if spoilers are detected.
